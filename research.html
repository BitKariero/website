									On October 31st, 2008, Satoshi Nakamoto announces<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup> that he has published a design
									paper for Bitcoin<sup><a href="#">[2]</a></sup>, “a new electronic cash system that’s fully peer-to-peer, with no
									trusted third party”.
									Block 0 of the Bitcoin blockchain, the Genesis Block, is established at 18:15:05 GMT
									on January 3rd, 2009<sup><a href="#">[3]</a></sup>. The block contains the message “The Times 03/Jan/2009
									Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks”<sup><a href="#">[4]</a></sup>.
									Version 0.1 of the Bitcoin software was released on January 9th, 2009<sup><a href="#">[5]</a></sup>.

								<p>
									The current system of electronic payments relies on trusted financial institutions to
									process transactions. This trust-based model has inherent weaknesses:
									<ul>
									  <li> Non-reversible transactions are not possible; disputes need to be mediated.</li>
									  <li>Small payments are infeasible; cost of mediation increases transaction costs.</li>
									  <li>Transactions are not anonymous; third party must collect personal information.</li>
									</ul>
									Bitcoin, on the other hand, is an electronic payment system based on <i>cryptographic
									proof of work</i> instead of trust, allowing two parties to transact directly with each other
									without the need for a trusted third party.

								<p>
									The Bitcoin paper gives a very high level overview of the system. It does not describe
									how Bitcoin is actually implemented. If you only read the paper, you will have an inexact
									(and in some cases incorrect) view of how Bitcoin works. For example, Bitcoin uses a
									stack-based scripting language for transactions<sup><a href="#">[6]</a></sup>, but the paper does not mention it at
									all.
								</p>
								<p>
									To get an accurate understanding of Bitcoin internals, check the source code<sup><a href="#">[7]</a></sup>, the
									developer guide<sup><a href="#">[8]</a></sup> and Mastering Bitcoin by Andreas Antonopoulos<sup><a href="#">[9]</a></sup>.

								<p>
									Bitcoin keeps a public ledger of all transactions, called the <i>block chain</i>. This is, in essence,
									a peer-to-peer distributed timestamp server. Its role is to prevent double spending and
									modification of previous transaction records.
								</p>
								<p>
									Each full node in the Bitcoin network keeps a complete copy of the block chain,
									containing all blocks validated by that particular node. Consistency across the network
									is guaranteed by following a series of <i>consensus rules</i>. When several nodes in the Bitcoin
									network independently arrive at identical block chains, they are considered to be in
									<i>consensus</i>.

									<p>
										A block chain, as the name suggests, is a digital <i>chain of blocks</i>. Each block contains
										a timestamp, a <i>nonce</i> (a number whose purpose will be described later) and a Merkle
										Tree<sup><a href="#">[11]</a></sup> that stores transactions.
									</p>
									<p>
										The blocks are cryptographically chained together using hashes. Each block contains
										the hash of the previous block, which in turn contains the hash of the previous, and so
										on back to the first block. Modifying any part of a past block would invalidate all the
										subsequent hashes. This is critical for preserving the integrity of the ledger.
									</p>
									<p>
										Computing a hash, however, is not very difficult. A usual CPU can compute roughly
										a million SHA-256 hashes per second. GPUs can compute hundreds of millions of hashes
										per second<sup><a href="#">[12]</a></sup>. ASICs (application-specific integrated circuits) are even faster. Under
										normal circumstances, it would be possible to modify previous blocks, as you could
										simply recompute all subsequent hashes.

									<h4><a href="#"><font color="rgb(0,0,92)">1.3.2 - Proof of Work</font></a></a></h4>
								</header>
								<p>
									The block chain is maintained collaboratively by peers on the Bitcoin network. To
									prevent malicious peers from modifying past blocks, the network requires a significant
									amount of work to be invested in the generation of each block. Chaining blocks together
									makes it impossible to modify transactions included in any block without modifying all
									following blocks.
								</p>
								<p>
									When there are multiple chains competing for acceptance in the network (for example,
									when someone tries to rewrite a past block), consensus rules dictate that nodes will pick
									as valid the chain that is longest, i.e. the chain that has most proof of work behind it
									<sup><a href="#">[13]</a></sup>.
								</p>
								<p>
									To successfully rewrite a past block, a malicious actor needs to re-generate all following
									blocks and overtake the honest nodes in the network. This is computationally infeasible,
									as long as honest peers control a large share of the total hashing power.
								</p>

							</section>

							<section>
								<header>
									<h4><a href="#"><font color="rgb(0,0,92)">Implementation</font></a></a></h4>
								</header>
								<p>
									The network only accepts a block as valid if the hash of its header is less than a certain
									<i>hash target</i>, which is computed based on the network <i>difficulty</i>. The network sets the
									difficulty and updates it every 2016 blocks<sup><a href="#">[14,15]</a></sup> so a block is generated, on average,
									every 10 minutes.
								</p>
								<p>
									Remember the nonce in the block header that we did not explain? This is where it
									comes in. The nonce is a 32 bit integer that you can increment to change the block’s
									hash. When mining, you try different nonces until the block header hashes to something
									less than the hash target.
								</p>
								<p>
									In practice, since the network difficulty is high, a 32 bit nonce is not enough to beat
									the hash target, so miners also change  <font face="courier">extraNonce</font>, a field included in the coinbase
									transaction of the block<sup><a href="#">[16,17,18]</a></sup>. As the coinbase transaction is included in the
									Merkle Tree, any change propagates upwards into the Merkle root in the header.

								<p>
									A transaction has at least one input and one output. For normal transactions, each
									input has to be the output of a previous transaction. When a transaction is made, each
									output waits as an Unspent Transaction Output (UTXO) until a later input spends it.
								</p>
								<p>
									It is important to note that coins are <strong>not fungible</strong>, i.e. they can be differentiated
									from one another, based on their chain of ownership. When your Bitcoin wallet tells
									you that you have a balance of 1,000 satoshis, it really means you have a total of 1,000
									satoshis waiting in one or more UTXOs.

								<header>
									<h4><a href="#"><font color="rgb(0,0,92)">Coinbase Transactions</font></a></a></h4>
								</header>
								<p>
									New coins are created in special transactions called <i>coinbase transactions</i><sup><a href="#">[21]</a></sup>. These
									have a special input field called <i>coinbase</i><sup><a href="#">[22]</a></sup>, which isn’t the output of a previous
									transaction — it creates coins.
								</p>
								<p>
									The Bitcoin network allows miners to include a coinbase transaction at the beginning
									of every block they mine. Miners claim the <i>block reward</i> by creating new coins for
									themselves.

									<h4><a href="#"><font color="rgb(0,0,92)">Transaction Fees</font></a></a></h4>
								</header>
								<p>
									If the total value of a transaction’s outputs is greater than the total value of its inputs,
									the difference can be collected by miners as a <i>transaction fee</i>, on top of the block reward
									they get for mining the block. If a transaction doesn’t have a fee, miners have no
									incentive to add it to their blocks.

									<h4><a href="#"><font color="rgb(0,0,92)">Transaction types</font></a></a></h4>
								</header>
								<p>
									Bitcoin uses a scripting system to process and define transactions. This language, called
									Script, is stack-based and is purposefully not Turing-complete<sup><a href="#">[6]</a></sup>.
								</p>
								<p>
									A script is a list of instructions recorded with each transaction that describes how
									a person who wants to spend the transaction’s outputs can gain access to them in the
									future. There are several main types of transactions:
								</p>
								<ul>
									<li>
										<strong>P2PKH</strong> - Pay to Public Key Hash
										<p>
											This is the most common type of transaction. To gain access to its outputs, the
											recipient needs to prove that he can sign a message with the private key (S) which
											corresponds to public key (P) that hashes to H.
										</p>
										<p>
											To create a transaction, the payer needs to know the recipient’s address.
										</p>
										<p>
											P2PKH addresses are the Base58Check encoding<sup><a href="#">[23]</a></sup> of version number 0, a hash
											of the recipient’s public key (H), and a checksum. Due to the way they are constructed,
											all P2PKH addresses start with the character “1” <sup><a href="#">[24]</a></sup>.
										</p>
										<p>
											Example: <u>1</u>BvBMSEYstWetqTFn5Au4m4GFg7xJaNVN2
										</p>
									</li>
									<li>
										<strong>P2PK</strong> - Pay to Public Key
										<p>
											With this transaction type, the public key itself is stored in the locking script,
											rather than a public-key-hash.
										</p>
										<p>
											P2PKH is an improvement on this, as it has shorter addresses and provides some
											security benefits (assuming addresses are not re-used).<sup><a href="#">[9]</a></sup>.
										</p>
									</li>
									<li>
										<strong>OP_RETURN</strong> - Data Output
										<p>
											Allows developers to add 40 bytes of non-payment data to a transaction output,
											which is stored on the block chain.<sup><a href="#">[9]</a></sup>
										</p>
									</li>

									<li>
										<strong>P2PSH</strong> - Pay to Script Hash
										<p>
											To gain access to outputs sent via P2SH, the recipient must provide a script which
											matches the given hash and data which makes that script evaluate to <font face="courier">True</font>.
										</p>
										<p>
											This allows the recipient to implement various unusual security schemes. For
											example, one can thus send bitcoins to <i>multi-signature addresses</i>, which require
											the signatures of multiple people to spend the outputs<sup><a href="#">[25]</a></sup>.
										</p>
										<p>
											P2SH addresses are the Base58Check encoding<sup><a href="#">[23]</a></sup> of version number 5, a hash
											of the recipient’s public key (H), and a checksum. Due to the way they are constructed,
											all P2SH addresses start with the character “3”<sup><a href="#">[24]</a></sup>.
										</p>
										<p>
											Example: <u>3</u>EktnHQD7RiAE6uzMj2ZifT9YgRrkSgzQX
										</p>
										<p>
											There is space for expansion, so more transaction types may be added in the future.
										</p>
									</li>
								</ul>

											<h4><a href="#"><font color="rgb(0,0,92)">1.3.4 Contracts</font></a></a></h4>
										</header>
										<p>
											Distributed contracts are a way of using Bitcoin transactions to enforce financial agreements.
											They can be used to formalise and guarantee agreements in a way that does not
											rely on the traditional court system. Example contracts include Escrow, Micropayment
											channels and CoinJoin<sup><a href="#">[8]</a></sup>.
										</p>
										<p>
											Several different types of contracts can be implemented in Script, but the language is
											not Turing-complete, so not all possible contracts can be implemented. For a block chain
											system specifically designed for smart contracts, check out Ethereum and its Turingcomplete
											contract language, Solidity.

									The Bitcoin protocol does facilitate a weak version of <i>smart contracts</i>, however the
									scripting language implemented in Bitcoin has several important limitations<sup><a href="#">[40]</a></sup>:
									<ul>
										<li><strong>Lack of Turing-completeness </strong> – the scripting language doesn’t have loops</li>
										<li><strong>Value blindness</strong> – cannot control what amount is withdrawn; either the entire UTXO is withdrawn, or none of it is</li>
										<li><strong>Lack of state </strong> – UTXOs scripts can only be used for one-off contracts; “stateful” multi-stage contracts such as decentralised organisations are impossible to implement</li>
										<li><strong>Blockchain blindness </strong> –cannot access blockchain data such as block headers or transaction history</li>
									</ul>
									Bitcoin, on the other hand, is an electronic payment system based on <i>cryptographic
									proof of work</i> instead of trust, allowing two parties to transact directly with each other

									<h3>Proposal</h3>
								</header>
								<p>
									We propose splitting our operations into two distinct units. One will run the core infrastructure, that is the protocol and CA cert lists, as an open and non-profit foundation. The other will provide value-added services on top of that in a for-profit manner.

									<h4>Sustainability as a Non-Profit Project</h4>
								</header>
								<p>
									Running the core system as a non-profit will be financially feasible since it will use a decentralised blockchain with no inherit need for costly hosting. Being open to all, as long as our technology is not surpassed, a for-profit company has no reason to clone the infrastructure – unless they want to create a walled-garden. Not having ours as a walled garden will make it more enticing for third parties to add integrations for it and to potentially contribute to the core. For the CA list we would use a similar process to the Mozilla CA Certificate Policy to add third parties in a fair and consistent manner.
								</p>

									<h4>Sustainability as a For-Profit Project</h4>
								</header>
								<p>
									As a for-profit we would provide an end user interface and hosting solution, whereby customers can have their own BitKariero profile hosted by us. On this profile they could include their verified references and records from the blockchain, and we will verify them and list them online in a manner that anyone can access without having to verify it themselves. Working off this, we could also provide tools for recruiters and companies to comb through these profiles. The for-profit will also provide APIs and work with other companies to implement integrations, and charge a commission for this work.
